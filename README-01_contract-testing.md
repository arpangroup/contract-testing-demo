# What is Contract Testing
Contract testing is a methodology for ensuring that two separate systems (such as two REST services) are compatible and communicate with one other. It captures the interactions that are exchanged between each service, storing them in a contract, which then can be used to verify that both parties adhere to it.  

# Types of Contract Testing

- #### Bi-Directional Contract Testing (BDCT)
  - [BDC Consumer Project]()
  - [BDC Provider Project]()
  - [See Video]()

- #### Consumer Driven Contract Testing (CDCT)
  - [CDC Consumer Project]()
  - [CDC Provider Project]()
  - [See Video]()


# How it measured?
Contract testing is assessed by examining the extent of contracts in Pactflow with verified pacts between consumer and provider.
### Reported Metrics:
- Successful Tests
- Active Contracts
### Logic:
- VERIFICATION_RESULT = "success" or "BIDIRECTIONAL_CONTRACTS" = "1"
- Month identified by `"VERIFICATION_TIME"`; if not available, then by `"PACT_CREATE_TIME"`
- **Successful Tests:**
  - Count of verified PACTS for both consumer and providers.
  - `"PRODUCT_LINE"` credited with test if either consumer or provider
  - `"PRODUCT_LINE"` only credited with single test if same for both consumer and provider
- **Active Contracts:**
  - Count of unique `INTEGRATION_ID`


# PactFlow Broker
PactFlow provides a centralize repository to manage contracts used during integration testing between consuming and producing service and applications. The Pact Broker is a **permanently running, externally hosted application with an API and UI that allows you exchange the pacts and verification results that are generated by the Pact tools.**

**pactBrokerUrl:** By specifying the pactBrokerUrl, this plugin connects to the Pact Broker to fetch the Pact files and verifies the provider against those contracts.

**Typical Workflow with This Plugin:**
1. **Consumer publishes a Pact:** The consumer (client) generates a Pact file that defines the expected interactions with the provider (API requests/responses).
2. **Pact Broker:** The Pact file is pushed to a Pact Broker (specified by pactBrokerUrl).
3. **Provider verification:** The provider uses the Pact Maven plugin to download the Pact files from the Pact Broker, and the plugin will verify that the provider’s API matches the interactions defined in the Pact file.






# FAQs
### Q1. Why pact contract testing is created on consumer side for CDCT?
Pact contract testing is created on the consumer side because of the consumer-driven contract approach. Here's why this design choice is important:
Pact contract testing is created on the **consumer side** because of the **consumer-driven contract** approach. Here's why this design choice is important:
1. **Consumer Expectations First:** The consumer defines the expectations for how the service (provider) should behave. Since the consumer relies on the provider’s API or service, it’s essential to know exactly what format and behavior to expect. By defining the contract on the consumer side, it reflects the actual needs of the consumer, ensuring that the provider's implementation will meet those needs.
2. **Simplifies Consumer Testing:** When consumers define the contract, they can write tests that validate their expected behavior from the provider without waiting for the provider to be ready. The consumer can mock the provider’s behavior based on the contract, enabling early testing of integration even before the provider's service is fully implemented.
3. **Reduces Provider’s Burden:** The provider doesn’t need to know about all possible consumers beforehand. It only needs to verify that it can fulfill the contract defined by the consumer. This reduces the need for the provider to manage tests for every possible consumer.
4. **Encourages Decoupling:** This approach helps decouple the development process. Consumers can evolve their requirements independently, and the provider can implement changes as long as they still honor the contract. This flexibility allows for parallel development of services with minimal coordination.
5. **Improved Collaboration:** By focusing on the consumer’s needs, Pact contract testing fosters a collaboration where the provider and consumer can align on expectations. It ensures that the contract reflects real use cases and can adapt to evolving consumer requirements.

### Q2. How a provider will verify the Contract if there is thousands of consumer? <br/>Isn't it a headache for provider to verify each consumers contract? 
### Q3. What if a particular consumers contract on providers test? How consumer will notify?
